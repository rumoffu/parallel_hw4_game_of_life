Implementation of the game of life in c

How to build:
use the makefile by typing: make
or you can type: mpicc game_of_life.c -o game_of_life

How to run:
type: mpirun -np num ./game_of_life
where num is the number of processors to run (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16)

This implementation used OpenMPI.
Specifically it used MPI synchronous send and MPI receive to
communicate grid updates between processors.
(MPI_Ssend and MPI_Recv)

The code is set to output the grid at each iteration, 
and the code is set to run for 64 iterations.
